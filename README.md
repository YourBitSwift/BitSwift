## 💡 Our Mission: Democratizing DeFi

At BitSwift, we're committed to breaking down the barriers that have kept DeFi out of reach for many. Our mission is threefold:

2. **Simplify Blockchain Concepts**: Through comprehensive educational resources, we're demystifying the complex world of blockchain and DeFi.
3. **Create an Inclusive Experience**: Our community-driven approach ensures that everyone has a voice in the BitSwift ecosystem.
